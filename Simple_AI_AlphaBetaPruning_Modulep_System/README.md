Combining sequential αβ-pruning algorithm and parallel Mini-Max algorithm to imple- ment simple A.I.
with high average winning rate and low waiting time. I have developed all the code in SML, a rigorious functional language that 
is ideal for proving correctness and effective computing. This project involves the use of module system and understanding 
of mini-max theory along with alpha-beta pruning techniques.
